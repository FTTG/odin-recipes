    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">The Hambagu Steak is an interesting take on a German dish that took a twist when it was first
        brought over to
        Japan. Delicious ground beef mixed with vegetables
        and panko (japanese breadcrumbs), pan fried and served with a delicious sweet sauce and vegetables.

        <li>3 Tbsp <b>tonkatsu sauce</b> (can substitute with Worcestershire sauce with sugar)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Making the Hambagu Patties</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut onions into small cubes</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat and saute the onions until tender and almost translucent. Place
            them on a bowl</li>
        <li>Once onions are cool, add beef and prok to the bowl. Add the salt and black pepper to taste, and the nutmeg
        </li>
        <li>Add the milk, panko, and egg</li>
        <li>Mix it all together with a spatula or a spoon</li>
        <li>Keep mixing by hand until its <b>sticky and pale</b></li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into quarters and scoop each up for each portion</li>
        <li>Toss each portion between your hands to release any air inside the mixture</li>
        <li>Lastly, shape them into an oval-shapped patty and place them on a tray. Cover the patties with plastic wrap
            and refrigerate them for <b>at least 30minutes</b> before cooking, so that the fat solidifies</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Cook the Hambagu</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat and place patties gently into the pan. Indent the center of each
            patty with to fingers, since the center will rise with the heat.</li>
        <li>Cook each patty until brown on the bottom, for <b>about 3 minutes.</b> Then flip and cook for <b>another 3
                minutes</b> until browned.</li>
        <li>Add red wine for steaming the patties and reduce heat to low. <em>Cover the pan with a lid</em> and cook for
            <b>5-7 minutes</b> to cook the inside of the patties.
        </li>
        <li>Test if patties are done by inserting a skewer; if clear juice comes out, it's done. Increase heat to medium
            again to let alcohol finish evaporating. Transfer the steaks to a plate. <strong>Do not wash the
                pan</strong> as you will use it for the sauce using the pan juices.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To make the Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same frying pan, add the unsalted butter, ketchup, and tonkatsu sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the water and red wine for the sauce to the pan.</li>
        <li>Mix well together and bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat; let the alcohol evaporate.</li>
        <li>When the sauce thickens (test by checking if you can draw a line at the bottom of the pan with a spatula),
            remove from the heat. Drizzle the sauce over the Hambagu steak. Save any leftover sauce in a bowl to use
            later or if anyone wants more! You can serve the steak with steamed rice, miso soup, and steamed vegetables
            or a salad.</li>
    </ol>
