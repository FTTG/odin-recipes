    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Hambagu Stake is an interesting take on a German dish that took a twist when it was first brought over to
        Japan. Delicious ground beef mixed with vegetables
        and panko (japanese breadcrumbs), pan fried and served with a delicious sweet sauce and vegetables.

        <li>Once onions are cool, add beef and prok to the bowl. Add the salt and black pepper to taste, and the nutmeg
        </li>
        <li>Add the milk, panko, and egg</li>
        <li>Mix it all together with a spatula or a spoon</li>

        <li>Divide the mixture into quarters and scoop each up for each portion</li>
        <li>Toss each portion between your hands to release any air inside the mixture</li>
        <li>Lastly, shape them into an oval-shapped patty and place them on a tray. Cover the patties with plastic wrap
            and refrigerate them for <b>at least 30minutes</b> before cooking, so that the fat solidifies</li>
